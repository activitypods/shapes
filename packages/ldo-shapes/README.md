# LDO Objects for ActivityPods

This package contains [ldo](https://ldo.js.org/) objects generated from SHEX shapes from `../shape-definitions/source`. You can use ldo, in a similar way that you would use ORMs - it brings you typed RDF data.

Run `yarn build` to generate the objects.

Note that you need to write the SHEX files manually for now.
